# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

A Python script that calculates statistical properties (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, sum) of a 3x3 matrix using NumPy.

## Project Description
This project was completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/). 

The function `calculate()` in `mean_var_std.py` takes a list of 9 numbers, converts it into a 3x3 matrix, and returns a dictionary of computed statistics.

## Features
- Calculates mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum
- Works along rows, columns, and flattened matrix
- Input validation for list length
- Returns results in a structured dictionary format

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Luser408/freecodecamp-mean-var-std.git# freecodecamp-numpy-calculator
